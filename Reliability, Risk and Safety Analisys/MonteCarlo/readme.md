# Monte Carlo Simulations
Theory regarding this topic was explained during lectures by prof. Baraldi

## First Exercise Session
05/04/2024 Giovanni Roma did the exercise session about montecarlo codes, we solved Exercise 1 and 2.1, while 2.2 was left to be done at home.  
I should try to do a script to *solve definite integrals*, which was explained by Giovanni on a theoretical level.
