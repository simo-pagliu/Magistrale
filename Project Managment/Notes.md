# Traditional Project Work
PIUTTOSTO CORTO DA FARE: Dire solo quello che abbiamo fatto chissene fotte della teoria.
## Executive Summary

This report presents the comprehensive planning and management of an industrial automation project developed in the context of the “Industrial Project Management A” course. The project was executed using traditional (waterfall) project management methodologies, with the goal of delivering a detailed and integrated plan that covers all phases from engineering design to final testing.

The work encompasses a structured breakdown of the project through multiple Work Breakdown Structures (WBS), organized respectively by phase, system, and location. Each WBS variant provided a distinct yet complementary perspective, facilitating clarity in task allocation, cost estimation, and responsibility mapping. Activities were defined with explicit precedence relationships, enabling the construction of a coherent Gantt chart and a network diagram used to identify the critical path and project float.

A full resource and cost breakdown analysis was conducted using real-world assumptions and project constraints. The CBS and associated charts such as the resource usage profile and S-curve allowed for evaluating cumulative effort, financial exposure, and potential optimization strategies. Furthermore, the project included the definition of a cash flow plan, identifying funding needs and timing of expenses, which proved critical in assessing the sustainability of early-start vs. late-start approaches.

The planning also addressed risk management, with a preliminary identification of key risks and mitigation strategies, and outlined a close-out strategy to ensure proper project handover. Although the primary structure followed a waterfall approach, agile elements were adopted during the group collaboration phase to iteratively refine the deliverables and adapt to team availability and feedback.

Overall, this project served as a hands-on application of the methodologies covered in the course, allowing a critical reflection on the interplay between planning tools and managerial decision-making in industrial projects.

## Project Charter

The Project Charter was developed at the conclusion of the planning phase, rather than at the outset. This choice was intentional: by first completing the full breakdown of tasks, structure, scheduling, and resource analysis, the scope and objectives of the project became clearer and more grounded in the actual complexity of the work. Defining the charter retrospectively allowed for a more accurate and comprehensive summary of the project’s rationale, boundaries, and key deliverables.

This approach also ensured alignment between the strategic goals and the operational details identified throughout the planning process. The finalized charter consolidates the refined understanding of stakeholders, constraints, and success criteria, effectively bridging theoretical planning tools with the practical needs of project execution.

## Scope Definition and WBSs

The scope of the project encompasses the complete lifecycle of an industrial automation system, from initial process engineering through procurement, construction, and testing of the final assembly. The objective is to provide a fully functional and validated skid-based system, ready for integration within a larger plant environment.

The scope was defined through a detailed decomposition using three complementary Work Breakdown Structures:

    WBS1: Phase-Oriented, organizing activities by Engineering, Procurement, Construction, and Testing.

    WBS2: System-Oriented, focusing on functional systems such as Process, Piping, Structural, and Electrical & Control.

    WBS3: Location-Oriented, organizing work by physical modules, including the Skid Frame, Piping Module, Equipment Zone, and Control Panel.

This multi-perspective breakdown ensured comprehensive coverage of all project components and facilitated cross-verification between deliverables, responsibilities, and cost/resource estimates.

Each Work Package (WP) includes:

    Estimated duration and required resources

    Logical dependencies enabling scheduling and critical path identification

The project includes approximately 70 interconnected activities, each linked by defined precedencies. All timing, cost, and resource inputs have been developed to support the use of professional project management tools (e.g., MS Project), ensuring that the plan could be realistically implemented in a real-world context.

Out of scope are post-deployment activities, such as on-site integration, operational training, and long-term maintenance, which are assumed to be managed in a separate phase by the client.

## Organizational Breakdown Structure (OBS)

The Organizational Breakdown Structure (OBS) was developed to define the distribution of responsibilities across functional domains and to ensure accountability throughout all phases of the project. It complements the Work Breakdown Structure by mapping each work package or group of activities to the organizational units responsible for their execution.

In this project, the OBS was structured to reflect the main functional areas involved:

    Engineering Department: responsible for process design, technical documentation, 3D modeling, instrumentation, and control logic

    Procurement Office: responsible for acquiring components, managing supplier relationships, and coordinating deliveries

    Construction Team: responsible for mechanical prefabrication, erection, and installation of piping, structures, and equipment

    Quality and Testing Unit: responsible for conducting factory acceptance tests (FAT), inspection activities, and final system validation

    Project Management Office (PMO): responsible for coordinating planning, progress tracking, and overall supervision

Each WBS element was cross-referenced with the OBS to clarify ownership and facilitate delegation of responsibilities. This linkage supports not only planning but also later phases of project control, risk management, and change handling.

By aligning the WBS with the OBS, we ensured that all deliverables have a designated owner and that no scope elements are left unassigned—an essential condition for effective execution in a complex, multidisciplinary project environment.


## Work Package Description

Each work package (WP) in the project represents a self-contained unit of work with clearly defined deliverables, responsible parties, resource allocations, and dependencies. The WP structure was derived from the WBS and refined to ensure completeness and traceability in both scheduling and cost estimation.

The purpose of this section is to present a standardized overview of selected work packages that cover the major functional and temporal segments of the project. This level of granularity ensures clarity in execution, aids progress tracking, and allows efficient allocation of both human and material resources.

The following template has been adopted for each WP description:
WP Name: [Insert Work Package Title]

    Description:
    [Brief explanation of the objective and scope of the WP]

    Estimated Duration: [e.g., 10 working days]

    Resources Involved:
    – External Engineering: €xxx
    – Internal Engineering: €xxx
    – Materials: €xxx
    – Supplier: €xxx

    Dependencies:
    [List of predecessor WPs or milestones]

    Responsible Unit (OBS): [e.g., Engineering Department]

    Risks / Notes:
    [Any known issues, constraints, or risk considerations]


## Cost Estimation

The project’s cost estimation was conducted by aggregating resource-based costs at the work package level, using data defined in the Work Breakdown Structure and refined through the Cost Breakdown Structure (CBS). Each task was associated with one or more resource categories, including:

    Materials

    External Engineering

    Supplier-provided Components

    Internal Manpower

    Internal Engineering

These were estimated either as lump-sum values (e.g., for procurement items and subcontracted services) or time-phased allocations (e.g., for internal labor and engineering hours).

The total projected cost of the project amounts to approximately €297,177, broken down into:

    External Costs: €263,097 (∼89%), including materials, external engineering, and supplier items

    Internal Costs: €34,080 (∼11%), including internal manpower and engineering

This distribution reflects the industrial nature of the project, where most of the value is embedded in externally sourced equipment and services.

The CBS structure helped validate consistency between WBS items and cost drivers, enabling cross-checks between time scheduling, deliverables, and financial expectations. Costs were also used as inputs for resource profiling, cash flow planning, and the S-curve analysis to ensure alignment across planning layers.

Overall, the estimation process supported the development of a financially traceable and executable project plan, suitable for future monitoring and control.

## Resource Management

Resource management in this project was structured around the identification, allocation, and time-distributed usage of five main resource categories: Materials, External Engineering, Supplier, Internal Manpower, and Internal Engineering. Each activity in the work plan was linked to one or more of these resources, with corresponding cost and workload estimates derived from realistic industrial assumptions.

To evaluate the temporal distribution of resources, a resource profile was generated by mapping resource usage across the project timeline. This visualization provided insights into peak demand periods, helping to identify potential bottlenecks and enabling smoothing strategies where feasible.

The allocation strategy distinguishes between:

    Continuous resources, such as internal engineering effort, distributed over the duration of the task

    Discrete or milestone-based resources, such as supplier costs, often assigned at the start or end of the procurement phase

The analysis showed that engineering resources are heavily concentrated in the early stages, while material and supplier-related expenses dominate the mid-project timeline. This time-phased resource mapping was essential not only for scheduling but also for generating accurate S-curves and conducting the cash flow analysis.

Overall, the resource management plan ensured that all deliverables were adequately supported, while also highlighting opportunities to optimize timing and reduce financial exposure.

## Scheduling and Time Management

The project schedule was developed by establishing clear precedence relationships among all identified tasks and then computing both early and late schedules to analyze flexibility and exposure. Using the defined network of dependencies, a full forward and backward pass was executed to determine the early start (ES), early finish (EF), late start (LS), and late finish (LF) for each activity, thereby identifying the critical path and available float.

Two scheduling strategies were compared:

    Early Start Plan: All tasks are scheduled as soon as possible.

    Late Start Plan: Tasks are delayed as much as possible without affecting the overall project duration.

The early start approach revealed a high financial and resource exposure during the initial and middle stages of the project. However, it also highlighted significant free float in non-critical activities, offering flexibility to optimize the allocation of resources and delay certain purchases or efforts without impacting the final delivery date.

To mitigate financial strain, a revised cash flow strategy was evaluated. In particular, we considered modifying the supplier payment structure from the traditional 50%-50% split (upfront and at delivery) to a more back-loaded scheme (e.g., 30% upfront, 70% at delivery). This adjustment could significantly reduce early cash outflows while maintaining supplier commitment.

The final schedule includes a Gantt chart showing all task durations and dependencies, as well as a network diagram for visualizing the logical sequence and critical path. Both resource loading profiles and S-curve charts were derived from the schedule to support time-phased cost and effort analysis.

## Cash Flow and Project Balance

A detailed cash flow analysis was carried out to assess the financial feasibility and sustainability of the project across its duration. Starting from the resource-loaded schedule, we computed both outflows (costs incurred) and inflows (client payments), generating a time-distributed cash flow curve and cumulative S-curve.

The analysis was first performed under a conventional early-start planning approach, which resulted in significant expenditure peaks during the early and mid-project phases. This front-loaded financial exposure, if not properly managed, could introduce liquidity risks and reduce the project's financial resilience.

To improve the financial balance, we explored alternative payment strategies. A revised scheme, such as shifting supplier payments from a 50%-50% split to a 30%-70% model, demonstrated potential to smooth cash outflows without compromising deliverables. This would delay a significant portion of expenses to later phases, aligning them more closely with revenue streams or funding milestones.

Additionally, the S-curve revealed that while cumulative effort and spending accelerate rapidly during engineering and procurement, there is a plateau near the end where spending slows and testing activities dominate. This information is crucial for resource and budget reallocation, as well as for negotiating better terms with vendors.

Overall, the cash flow assessment allowed us to identify imbalances and propose realistic mitigation strategies, supporting a more stable financial trajectory for the project.

## Risk Management

Risk management in this project was approached as a proactive process aimed at identifying, evaluating, and mitigating potential threats that could impact the project’s objectives in terms of time, cost, quality, or scope. Although the project follows a waterfall structure, early-stage risk analysis was integrated into the planning process to ensure responsiveness throughout execution.

Risks were categorized into four main areas:

    Technical risks: e.g., errors in engineering deliverables, design rework

    Procurement risks: e.g., supplier delays, component unavailability

    Construction risks: e.g., site conditions, labor productivity issues

    Managerial risks: e.g., coordination failures, scope creep

Each identified risk was evaluated based on its probability of occurrence and potential impact, allowing prioritization through a basic qualitative risk matrix. For example:

    Supplier delay of critical components: high impact, medium probability → mitigated by defining early procurement milestones and backup suppliers

    Engineering rework due to incomplete inputs: medium impact, medium probability → mitigated through internal peer reviews and phased document releases

Where appropriate, float identified during the scheduling phase was used as a buffer against timeline risks, particularly for non-critical path activities. For financial risks, such as cost overruns, resource usage profiles and cash flow models were used to simulate stress scenarios.

Risk monitoring would be conducted periodically throughout execution, with the possibility of introducing corrective actions or updated contingency plans when necessary. This ensures that risk management remains a continuous and adaptive process.

## Progress Evaluation

Progress evaluation in this project is designed to ensure timely monitoring, early detection of deviations, and proactive corrective actions. The structure of the plan supports tracking at the Work Package (WP) level, with progress assessed based on both physical completion and resource consumption.

Key metrics identified for progress tracking include:

    Percentage of completion per WP, updated based on deliverables or milestone achievement

    Planned vs. Actual Timeline Comparison, using Gantt chart overlays

    Earned Value Analysis (EVA) indicators such as:

        EV (Earned Value): value of work completed to date

        PV (Planned Value): baseline expectation at that time

        AC (Actual Cost): real cost incurred to date

        SPI / CPI: schedule and cost performance indices

In addition, control points were defined at the end of major project phases (e.g., end of engineering, procurement, mechanical erection), enabling formal milestone reviews and progress validation.

The early identification of float in the schedule also offers flexibility: in case of delays in non-critical tasks, corrective actions can be prioritized without impacting the overall project duration.

Regular progress updates would be conducted through weekly or bi-weekly reviews with the responsible OBS units, ensuring alignment between planning and execution throughout the project lifecycle.

## Close-Out

The project close-out phase is structured to ensure a controlled and verifiable conclusion of all planned activities. It includes both technical and administrative procedures required to formally complete the project, deliver final outputs, and transfer responsibility to the client or end-user.

Close-out begins with a comprehensive review of completed deliverables against the original scope, using predefined acceptance criteria. This ensures that all outputs conform to expected quality levels and contractual obligations. Special attention is given to testing-related activities such as Factory Acceptance Tests (FATs), dimensional checks, and non-destructive testing (NDT), which serve as key verification milestones for both structural and process components.

Documentation is a critical part of the close-out phase. A complete Documentation Pack is prepared, including design files, test reports, certificates, and any as-built documentation. This package supports future maintenance, regulatory compliance, and operational readiness.

From a managerial perspective, the close-out process includes:

    Final resource and cost reconciliation

    Lessons learned documentation

    Closure of procurement contracts

    Internal debriefs with functional units

Only after formal acceptance and administrative closure will the project be considered fully concluded. This approach ensures transparency, traceability, and organizational learning for future projects.

## Lessons Learned

Developing this project plan provided valuable insights into the practical application of traditional project management methodologies. One key takeaway was the importance of thoroughly defining the Work Breakdown Structure before attempting scheduling or cost estimation. Iterating through different WBS perspectives (phase, system, location) not only improved clarity but also revealed gaps that would have otherwise gone unnoticed.

We also learned that planning tools are only as effective as the assumptions behind them—small inaccuracies in task durations or dependencies can significantly impact the schedule and resource distribution. Comparing early and late start strategies helped us better understand the trade-offs between flexibility and financial exposure, especially when considering cash flow constraints.

From a team perspective, applying Agile principles informally during our internal coordination—such as short sync meetings and incremental reviews—proved helpful even within a waterfall framework. This hybrid approach improved our ability to adapt and converge on a coherent final output.

Overall, the exercise reinforced the value of structured planning while highlighting the need for constant validation and communication across team roles.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrated the comprehensive application of traditional project management techniques to a semi-real industrial case. Through the structured development of scope, scheduling, cost estimation, and resource planning, we were able to produce a coherent and executable plan aligned with professional standards. The integration of multiple WBS structures and detailed resource and cost breakdowns enabled a multi-dimensional view of the project, enhancing control and traceability.

Beyond the technical deliverables, the project offered an opportunity to reflect on planning decisions, evaluate scheduling alternatives, and explore the financial implications of different execution strategies. It also highlighted the benefit of blending formal planning tools with agile collaboration methods, especially in a team setting.

Overall, the work confirmed that while planning methodologies offer a strong foundation, their real value emerges when combined with critical thinking, iteration, and clear communication. The deliverables presented here lay the groundwork for successful project execution, while the lessons learned will inform future project management efforts, both academic and professional.
