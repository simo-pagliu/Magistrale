    "a) Assuming nuclear fuel costs are fixed, what price will coal fuel costs have to rise (as % of current cost) to make nuclear electric generation economically attractive at the stated capacity factors?\n",
    "\n",
    "b) What must the nuclear capital cost have to reduce (as % of current cost) to make nuclear electric generation economically attractive at the stated capacity factors?\n",
    "\n",
    "c) Re-answer Part b) but now assume coal unitâ€™s capacity factors rise to be equal to nuclear capacity factors (i.e., 90%). In doing this, assume that the total yearly capital and O&M costs are independent of capacity factors.\n"
