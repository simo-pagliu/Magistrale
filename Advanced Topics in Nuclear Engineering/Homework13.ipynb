    "Answer each of the following questions regarding the mass of waste material produced (waste rock, mill tailings solid, enrichment tails, and SNF [in terms of original mass]) at each stage of the nuclear fuel cycle by using the calculational capability found at the following website: http://www.wise-uranium.org/nfcm.html (may employ default values).\n",
