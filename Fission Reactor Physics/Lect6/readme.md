# Lecture 6 - 29/02/2024
Following **Chapter 3** of the book (Duderstand - Hamilton): 
Comparison for charateristic parameters form the four factor formula between LWR and CANDU reactors, K~∞~ behaviour in a CANDU reator, breeding reactors (convertion or breeding factor)

## Exercise 1
From slide 20 compute a simplified value of K from the neutron "distribution tree" and compute the Convertion Factor

## Exercise 2.22 and 3.6
Computation of K~∞~ varing fuel enrichment
The two exercises are basically identical
