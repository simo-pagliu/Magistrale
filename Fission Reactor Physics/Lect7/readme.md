# Lecture 7 - 05/03/2024
Following **Chapter 4** of the book (Duderstand - Hamilton): 
Topics: Introduction to basic quantities useful for the neutron transport model
 - Requirements of the model
 - Neutron density
 - Reaction rate density
 - Neutron flux (Not a mathematical flux, is a scalar)
 - Current Density (Mathematically correct Flux, is a vector)

All quantities as "normal", in respect to Energy $(E)$, in respect to the solid angle $(\Omega)$ and both $(E, \Omega)$

At last, 

## Ex. 4.2
Really simple example to understand how the quantities behave (vector and scalar quantities)
