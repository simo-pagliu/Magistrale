# Lecture 20 - 04/04/2024
On the theory of **Chapter 5** of the book (Duderstand - Hamilton)  
We did some exercises regarding the criticality condition of a reactor

## Python Exercise
- Compute the critical core volume 
- Neutron leakage fraction from the critical core 
- Neutron lifetime

## By hand Exercise
Criticality Condition of a box reactor. Find the critical condition.  
Second request was to minimize the volume (Riva showed us 2 possible ways to solve this).
