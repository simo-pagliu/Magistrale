# Lecture 3 - 22/02/2024
Focus on nucleus related reactions, cross sections, definition of uncollided flux, macroscopic cross section, auxiliary quantities and probability of exponential distributions

## Exercise 2.6
Presented during lecture, left for home. (Last Slide)
Correct, *Rooijen* suggests to, instead of using the total macroscopic cross section $\Sigma _{tot}$, to only consider absorption $\Sigma _{a}$,so that the solution takes into account any neutron that had interactions different from absorpition: a neutron can be scattered but that doesn't mean that it will stop where is was scattered.
The solution remains unchanged with the two approaches.

## Exercise 2.7
Presented during lecture, left for home. (Last Slide)
Correct, Reaction rate for a thin target is give, by definition:
$$R = \sigma_t I N_A$$
The interaction rate of an individual nucleus is given by the same, removing teh atomic density $N_A$ from the expression.
