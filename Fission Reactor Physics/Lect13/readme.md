# Lecture 13 - 19/03/2024
Following **Chapter 4** of the book (Duderstand - Hamilton): 

We followed the last part of the Chapter, focusing on the Boundary and Initial conditions for the diffusion equation.  
Basically we started from the transport equation conditions which are correct and mathematical derived, and then we try to "translate" them for the diffusion equation (which is an approximation).  
The result is that the conditions of the diffusion equation is not an exact condition but approximation of those conditions.
