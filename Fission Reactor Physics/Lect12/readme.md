# Lecture 12 - 14/03/2024
Following **Chapter 4 - Section IV Subsection C and D** of the book (Duderstand - Hamilton): 
- From the Boltzmann neutron transport equation to the diffusion equation
- Approximations
- Energy Dependant expression (just cited, didn't get into much detail)

Basically all section **C**, presented in a different manner but the result is the same (the book's approach is a bit faster and is sufficient for the exam), section **D** was just cited (existance of the *Energy dependant diffusion equation*).  
We then exposed the points of section **E**, without going into detail, they just explained the diffusion equation limitations: *See Notes*  

## Study Note:
It is worth it to take a good look at section **B** since it recaps quite well all the userful approximations used during this and previous lecture

## Ex.
We did, once again, an exercise from an exam regarding net number of neutrons $J$ and tot number of neutrons $\Phi$.
